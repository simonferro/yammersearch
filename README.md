SQL Project about Yammer Search

Project information: https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/understanding-search-functionality/

Yammer is a fictional company, whose product team is considering working on the search functionality for their next sprint. They are interested in knowing whether they should tackle search or not and, if so, what can be improved.

There are two tables relevant for the analysis, which can be seen on the link above. The table "users" includes information about the user account, while the table "events" includes raw event data from events such as search, but also from events like login and signup.

# *Objective* 

Understand whether the product team should be working in the search functionality and, if so, recommending in which way the should be improving the functionality.
